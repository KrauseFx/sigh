# Installation
    sudo gem install sign

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

# Usage

    sign
Yes, that's the whole command!

You can pass parameters like this:

    sign -a at.felixkrause.app -u username

If you want to generate an Ad Hoc profile instead:

    sign --development

By default, Sign will install the downloaded profile on your machine. If you just want to generate the profile and skip the installation, use the following flag:

    sign --skip_install


## Environment Variables
In case you prefer environment variables:

- ```SIGN_USERNAME```
- ```SIGN_APP_IDENTIFIER```

# How does it work?

Sign will access the iOS Dev Center to download, renew or generate the ```.mobileprovision``` file. Check out the full source code: [developer_center.rb](https://github.com/KrauseFx/sign/blob/master/lib/sign/developer_center.rb).


## How is my password stored?
Sign uses the password manager from [Deliver](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver#can-i-trust-deliver). Take a look the [Deliver README](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver#can-i-trust-deliver) for more information.
